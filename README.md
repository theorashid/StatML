Lab sessions from the Machine Learning course by Dr Sarah Filippi at Imperial College London

Lab 1 -- Supervised learning with linear regression models
Investigate the effect that increasing model complexity has on the mean squared error (MSE), and consider the use of cross validation as a means of choosing the most appropriate predictive model, and examine the impact of regularisation techniques.

Lab 2 -- Perform classification via Linear Discriminant Analysis and logistic regression
