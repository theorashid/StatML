Lab sessions from the Machine Learning course by Dr Sarah Filippi at Imperial College London

Lab 1 -- Supervised learning with linear regression models
Investigate the effect that increasing model complexity has on the mean squared error (MSE), and consider the use of cross validation as a means of choosing the most appropriate predictive model, and examine the impact of regularisation techniques.

Lab 2 -- Perform classification via Linear Discriminant Analysis and logistic regression

Lab 3 -- Pricipal Component Analysis and Clustering (K-means and hierarchical)

Lab 4 -- Random Forests and Neural Networks

GP -- Gaussian process exercise set by Dr Seth Flaxman. Investigate different kernels, fit a GP to some data, maximise the marginal likelihood to find the best hyperparameters
